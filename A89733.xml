            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Life and Death OF Mr <hi>JOHN COTTON,</hi> The late Reverend Teacher of the Church of Chriſt, at <hi>Boſton</hi> in NEVY-ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>IT is the priviledg of the bleſſed who lived in Heaven, whilſt they lived on Earth; That they may live on Earth, whilſt they live in Heaven. And 'tis a part of the Portion of the Saints, that (together with the benefit of the living) they may enjoy both the life and death of thoſe, who both lived and dyed in the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22. Hebr. 11. 4.</note> Faith. <hi>Life and Death are yours.</hi> By Faith <hi>Abel</hi> being dead many thouſand years ſince, yet ſpeaketh, and will ſpeak whil'ſt time ſhall be no more. That the living ſpeak, is no wonder: but that the dead ſpeak, is more then miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. This, though it be enough to draw forth attention from the ſons of men; Who is not affected with miracles? yet being influenced with a Divine and ſpecial Benediction; for the memorial of the Juſt is bleſſed: To ſuppreſs an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo much good with ſilence, were not only unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119081:3"/>
to the dead, but an injury to the generation preſent, and to many an one that is to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To preſerve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the bleſſed with the Spices and ſweet Odors of their Excellencies and Weldoing, recorded to poſterity, is a ſuper-<hi>Aegyptian</hi> embalming, and a ſervice which many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons perſwade unto.</p>
            <p>This we do as men; glad to reſcue and ſolicitous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any excellency in the Sons of mortality, that may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live Death; deſire of continuance in being, is in it ſelf inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable from being. Dumb Pictures of deſerving men an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer not ingenuous minds capable to retain the memorial of vertue, the real effigies of their Spirits. Beſides unhappy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, happily expiring with the life of the emulated: We greedily own and enjoy ſuch Worthies, when they are not, whom envy in a great Degree bereaved us of, whilſt they were.</p>
            <p>This we do as Friends; hence the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Poet of old, <note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Nam is demum eſt amicus qui etiam extincti memoriam ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, ejuſque cauſâ dolet, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet non amplius ſuperſtes ſit.</hi> Heb. 11. 36.</note> He is a true friend, who continueth the memory of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friend. And this is done, not only in love to them, but alſo in love to our ſelves, thereby eaſing in part our loſs, and ſaving ſo much of our own lives. He may the better be heard, who reckoned his Friend the one half of himſelf: when <hi>Moſes</hi> intimates a Friend to be as our own Soul; whilſt <hi>Calvin</hi> lives, <hi>Beza's</hi> life is ſweet; when <hi>Calvin</hi> dyes, death is the more acceptable unto <hi>Beza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This we do as Chriſtians: The Deeds of thoſe worthies was the ſubject matter of the ſpeech of the Saints; theſe all obtained a good Report. A conſiderable part of the Scripture is a divine teſtimony of what the Faithful have done and ſuffered, recorded unto ſucceeding Generations, not only as a memorial of them, but as ſo many practical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Faithfulneſs of God: as ſo many full and glorious triumphs over the World, Sin and Satan, obtained by perſons in like temptations, and ſubject to like paſſions with our ſelves. A quickning motive unto ſuch who have underſtanding of the times, not to pretermit thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the ſignal preſence of God in whom, manifeſts them to have been fore-appointed, for the further compleating of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119081:3"/>
that Cloud of Witneſſes which elevates the Beholders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to lay aſide every weight that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and with the ſame ſpirit to run the race that is ſet before us.</p>
            <p>The Myſtery of God, concerning all the tranſactions of his eternal purpoſe upon the Theatre of this World, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole time of time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being fully accompliſhed and revealed, (that of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf excepted) in none of all the work which he hath gloriouſly done, will he be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired ſo much in that day, as in what he hath wrought in the lives and deaths of Beleevers, as Beleevers. The ſame object is as admirable now as then; that it is not ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, is, becauſe it is not ſeen now ſo much as it ſhall be then. The greateſt Object out of Heaven is the life and death of ſuch upon Earth, who are now in Heaven. You may beleeve it, what God hath done for the Soul of the leaſt Saint of ſome few years continuance, were it digeſted into Order, would make a volume full of temptations, ſignes, and wonders: A wonderful Hiſtory, becauſe a Hiſtory of ſuch experiences, each one whereof is more then a Wonder. No greater acts then their obedience, both Active and Paſſive unto the death. The ſufferings of the Apoſtles may well be reckoned amongſt the Acts of the Apoſtles. No greater Monuments then their Regiſter: To live and die in the Faith of Jeſus; to do things worthy to be written, and to write things worthy to be done, both is good, and doth good, 'Tis better with <hi>William Hunter,</hi> then with <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. 'Tis better to have a name in the Book of Martyrs then in the Book of Chronicles. Martial Conquerors conquer Bodies, by deſtroying. Confeſſors conquer Souls, by ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and the word of his Teſtimony, and loved not their lives unto the death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Amongſt theſe, as the Age that now is (through Grace) hath abounded with many worthies, ſo This Eminent Servant of God, the ſubject of our preſent meditation, may without wrong unto any be placed amongſt the firſt Three. Had it pleaſed the only wiſe God to have put it into his heart to have imitated <hi>Junius,</hi> in leaving behind him the Hiſtory
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119081:4"/>
of his own Life, how many would have gladly received it, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did the Mantle which fell from <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he was caught up and carried from him into Heaven: But Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence otherwiſe diſpoſing, it remains, that they who have known his doctrine, manner of Life, purpoſe, Faith, Long-ſuffering, Love, Patience, Perſecutions, and affliction, do not ſuffer ſuch a Light to be hid under a Buſhel, but put it on a Candleſtick, that it may give light to them that are in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>His Birth-place, <hi>Dorby,</hi> we ſhall not detain the Reader at, <note place="margin">His birth.</note> though a Scituation in reſpect of the purity, and frequent Agitation of the air, attempered (in the judgment of the Orator) for the breeding of better Wits, Creatures are in their kind ſubſervient; but, tis God, (not the air) who puts Wiſdom into the inward parts, and giveth underſtanding to the heart. As the wiſe man and the Fool die, ſo are they both ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily born in the ſame place. The glory of every good and perfect gift reſerved for the Father of Lights.</p>
            <p>Let it be ſufficient to acknowledge both the place an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to the perſon, and the perſon an honor to the place. What <hi>Baſil</hi> ſometime commended in the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the ſame is to be looked at in our Confeſſor (or Martyr, which you pleaſe) namely, that his praiſe is not to be derived from his Country here below, wherein he was born: But from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto that <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which is above, where he was inſtrumentally born again, according unto Grace. The mercy of a good Deſcent which the joint-conſent of all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, hath always voted not to be the leaſt part of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happineſs, God bleſſed him with from the womb. His parents being perſons of conſiderable quality, and of good reputation. Their condition, as to the things of this Life, competent; neither unable to defray the expence of his education in literature, nor ſo abounding as to be a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the other hand unto the neglect thereof. <hi>Crates</hi> the Philoſopher would needs go unto the higheſt place of the City and cry in the audience of all the people, O men! whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go ye? why take ye ſo much pains to gather riches for your Children, and have no care to train them up, who ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119081:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enjoy them? And <hi>Plutarch</hi> was wont to ſay, that he would add but this one thing thereunto; That ſuch men as theſe were, are very like to them who are very careful for the ſhooe, and take no care for the foot. But God who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined this then tender plant to be a Tree of Life for the feeding of many thouſands, to be a choſen Veſſel to bear his name before the Nations; in way thereunto inſpired his Parents with an effectuall ſollicitude concerning the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the child in his Minority. The Grecians called Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Erudition, <hi>Paideia;</hi> The word it ſelf a loud admonition <note place="margin">

Though vain man would be wiſe, yet may he be compared to the Cubb, as well as to the wild Aſſes Colt: Now we know the Bear when ſhe bringeth forth her young ones, they are an ill-favoured lump, a maſſe without ſhape; but by continuall licking. they are brought to ſome form. Children are called Infants of the <note place="margin">Lam. 2. 20.</note> palms, or Educations, not becauſe they are but a ſpan in length, but becauſe the Midwife, as ſoon as they are born, <note place="margin">

            <p>This care in the Parents was quickly above expectation encouraged in the Firſt-Fruits of their young Sons profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, more and more increaſing great hopes concerning him throughout the whole time of his minority, wherein he was trained up in the Grammar-School of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The manner of his Converſion take in his own words (as neer as can be remembred) thus. During his reſidence in <note place="margin">The manner of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</note> the Univerſity, God began to work upon him under the miniſtery of Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> of bleſſed memory. But the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſtirrings of his heart which then were, he ſuppreſſed; thinking that if he ſhould trouble himſelf with matters of Religion, according to the light he had received, it would be an hindrance to him in his ſtudies, which then he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himſelf unto. Therefore he was willing to ſilence thoſe ſuggeſtions and callings he had from the Spirit inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and did wittingly defer the proſecution of that work until afterwards. At length; walking in the field, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bell toll for Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> who then lay dying, he was ſecretly glad in his heart, that he ſhould now be rid of him who had (as he ſaid) laid ſiege to and beleaguer'd his heart. This became a cauſe of much affliction to him, God keeping it upon his ſpirit, with the aggravation of it, and making it an effectual meanes of convincing and humbling him in the ſight and ſenſe of the natural enmity that is in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119081:7"/>
mans nature againſt God. Afterwards, hearing Doctor <hi>Sibbs,</hi> (then Mr <hi>Sibbs)</hi> preaching a Sermon about Regeneration, where he firſt ſhewed what Regeneration was not, when opening the State of a Civil man, he ſaw his own condition fully diſcovered, which through mercy did drive him to a ſtand, as plainly ſeeing himſelf to have no true grace, all his falſe hopes and grounds now failing him: And ſo he lay a long time in an uncomfortable deſpairing way; and of all things, this was his heavieſt burthen, that he had witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withſtood the meanes and offers of grace and mercy which he found had been tendred to him; till it pleaſed God to let in ſome word of Faith into his heart, to cauſe him to look unto Chriſt for healing, which word (if memory faileth not) was diſpenſed unto him by Doctor <hi>Sibbs;</hi> which begat in him a ſingular and conſtant love of Doctor <hi>Sibbs,</hi> of whom he was alſo anſwerably beloved</p>
            <p>That which firſt made him famous in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was his <note place="margin">His fame in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</note> Funeral Oration for Doctor <hi>Some,</hi> Maſter of Peter-houſe; ſo accurately performed, in reſpect of Invention, Elegancy, Purity of Style, Ornamens of Rhetorick, Elocution, and Oratorious beauty of the whole, as that he was thenceforth looked at as another <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or <hi>Muſa Attica</hi> throughout the Univerſity. Some ſpace of time intervening, he was called to Preach at St <hi>Maries,</hi> where he preached an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity-Sermon, with high applauſe of Academical Wits, ſo that the fame of his learning grew greater and greater. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being called to preach in the ſame place, as one Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pericles</hi> left the hearer with an Appetite of another; ſo the memory of his former accurate Exerciſes, filled the Colledges, eſpecially the young Students with a freſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſuch Elegancies of Learning, that the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Corinthian Wits, who prefer the <hi>Muſes</hi> before <hi>Moſes,</hi> who taſte <hi>Plato</hi> more then <hi>Paul,</hi> and reliſh the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of <hi>Athens</hi> far above the Preacher of the Croſs, (like <hi>Quintilians</hi> numerous Auditory, ſufficient to tempt the abilities of the Speaker) flock to the Sermon with an <hi>Athenian</hi> Itch after ſome new thing, as to the Ornaments of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and abſtruſer notions of Philoſophy. But his Spirit now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119081:8"/>
ſavouring of the Croſs of Chriſt more then of Humane lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, and being taught of God to diſtinguiſh between the word of wiſdom, and the wiſdom of words; his ſpeech and preaching was not with the enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in the demonſtration of the Spirit and of power.</p>
            <p>The diſappointed expectation of the Auditory ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their countenances; and the diſcouragement of their non-acceptance returned him unto his chamber not without ſome ſadder thoughts of heart. Where he had not been long alone, but lo, Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> (then Maſter <hi>Preſton)</hi> knocks at his door, and coming in, acquaints him with his ſpiritual condition, and how it had pleaſed God to ſpeak effectually unto his heart by that Sermon: After which, Doctor <hi>Preston</hi> ever highly prized him, and both fully and ſtrongly cloſed with him. Which real ſeal of God unto his Miniſtry comforted his ſoul, far above what the preſent leſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance of the Auditory had dejected him, or their former acceptance encouraged him. This brings to mind that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated ſtory of the Converſion of the Heathen Philoſopher at <hi>Nice,</hi> which God wrought by the means of an antient and pious Confeſſor, plainly declaring unto him the doctrine of Faith, after that many Chriſtian Philoſophers had by Philoſophical diſputations laboured in vain. Chriſt evidently held forth, is Divine Eloquence, the Eloquence of Eloquence. God will not have it ſaid of Chriſt, as <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> That he was beholden to the pen of him that publiſhed his Acts. 'Tis Chriſt that is preached, not the tongue of the Preacher, to whom is due all praiſe. Such inſtances conclude, that <hi>Paul</hi> is more learned then <hi>Plato.</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh between ineptneſs of ſpeech, Carnal Rhetorick, and Eloquent Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimplicity; between Ignorance, Oſtentation, and Learning. <hi>The Preacher ſought to find out acceptable words,</hi> and words of truth.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Concio ad Clerum,</hi> when he proceeded Bachelor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity (after he had been at <hi>Boſton</hi> about half a year) was very much admired and commended. His text was <hi>Mat. 5. 13. V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> made their addreſs, ſaying, <hi>Come and help us!</hi> And in that Candleſtick the Father of ſpirits placeth this burning and ſhining light: To whom he removed from <hi>Cambridge</hi> about the 28. year of his age. At the firſt he met with ſome obſtructions from the Dioceſan, then Biſhop <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe,</hi> who told him that he was a young man, and unfit to be ſet over ſuch a divided people. Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> being ingenuous, and undervaluing himſelf, thought ſo too, and purpoſed to return to the College again: But ſome of his <hi>Boſton-</hi>friends underſtanding that one <hi>Simon Biby</hi> was to be ſpoken with, who was neer to the Biſhop, they preſently charmed him, and ſo the buſineſs proceeded without further trouble, and Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> was admitted into the place after their manner in thoſe days.</p>
            <p>Two things are here not unworthy of obſervation, (which he would ſometimes ſpeak of to his friends:) Firſt, that in the beginning of his Miniſtery, he was exerciſed with ſome inward troubles which much dejected him. No ſooner had Chriſt received his miſſion into his publick miniſtery, but he is led into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil. Wiſe <hi>Heman</hi> ſuffered the horrors of God, and was laid in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pit. The Doctor of the Gentiles ſtood in need of being buffered by Satan. The Tempter is in Chriſts hand, and an inſtrumental winnower of the Diſciples. His fiery darts, through the influence of him who ſuccors thoſe that are tempted, cleanſe as well as ſmart; and this cleanſing efficacie remains when the ſmart is over. From the experience of this Archer, are the choiſe Shepherds in Iſrael. Good ſpirits are much better'd by their conflicts with the worſt of ſpirits: Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Preachers are often trained up in the ſchool of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119081:9"/>
ſo true is that theological maxim; Meditation, Prayer, and <note place="margin">Tria faciunt Theologum, meditatio, ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, tentatio.</note> Temptation make a Divine. This diſpenſation of the all-wiſe God he afterwards found not only to be beneficial to him, in preparing his heart for his work, but alſo that it became an effectual means of his more peaceable and comfortable ſettlement in that place, where the people were divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, by reaſon of a potent man in the Town, who adhered to another <hi>Cambridge-</hi>man, whom he deſired to bring in. But when they ſaw M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cotton</hi> wholly taken up with his own exerciſes of ſpirit, they were free from all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his being pragmatical, or addicted to ſiding with this or that Party, and ſo began to cloſe more fully with him.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, Whereas there was an Arminian party in that Town, ſome of whom were witty, and troubled others with diſputes about thoſe points, by Gods bleſſing upon his labours in holding forth poſitively ſuch Truths as undermined the foundations of Arminianiſm, thoſe Diſputes ceaſed, and in time Arminianiſm was no more pleaded for. So God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of the hearts of hearers, as that generally they are all open and loving to their Preachers in their firſt times: Trials are often reſerved until afterwards. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calleth the firſt year of Chriſts miniſtery, the acceptable year. The Diſciples in their firſt miſſion want nothing, and return all ſafe; but after his death they met with other entertainment, and come ſhort home. Young <hi>Peter</hi> girdeth himſelf and walks whither he will; but Old <hi>Peter</hi> is girded by another, and carried whither he would not.</p>
            <p>For three or four years he lived and preached among them without oppoſition; they accounted themſelves happy (as well they might) in the enjoyment of him, both the Town and Country thereabout being much bettered and reformed by his labours. After, not being able to bear the Ceremonies impoſed, his Non-conformity occaſioned his trouble in the Court of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> from whence he was adviſed to appeal to a higher Court: And imploying M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119081:9"/>
ſpiritual bleſſing, ſo far inſinuated himſelf into one of the Proctors of that high-Court, that Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> was treated by them as if he were a conformable man, and ſo was reſtored unto <hi>Boſton.</hi> (Likewiſe by the ſame meanes it was, that a Gentleman of <hi>Boſton,</hi> called Mr <hi>Benner,</hi> uſed occaſionally afterwards to bring him in again:) After this time he was bleſſed with a ſucceſsful Miniſtry, unto the end of twenty years. In which ſpace he on the Lords-day, in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons, went over the whole body of Divinity in a Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſtical way thrice, and gave the heads of his diſcourſe, to thoſe that were young Schollars, and others in the Town, to anſwer his queſtions in publick in that great Congregation; and after their anſwers he opened thoſe heads of Divinity, and finally applyed all to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people, and to ſuch ſtrangers as came to hear him. In the morning on the Lords day, he preached over the firſt ſix Chapters of the Goſpel of <hi>John;</hi> the whole book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> the Propheſie of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> and many other Scriptures, and when the Lords Supper was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred (which was uſually every moneth,) He preached upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and 2 <hi>Chron. 30. per totum,</hi> and ſome other Scriptures concerning that Subject. On his Lecture days, he preached thorough the whole Firſt and Second Epiſtles of <hi>John,</hi> the whole book of <hi>Solomons Song,</hi> the Parables of our Saviour ſet forth in <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel to the end of Chapter 16. compairing them with <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke:</hi> He took much pains in private, and read to ſundry young Schollars, that were in his Houſe, and ſome that come out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and had his houſe full of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. Afterwards, ſeeing ſome inconvenience in the Peoples flocking to his houſe, beſides his ordinary Lecture on the 5 day of the Week, he preached thrice more in publick on the Week days. On the fourth and fifth days early in the morning, and on the laſt day at three of the clock in the afternoon. Only theſe three laſt Lectures were performed by him but ſome few years before he had another famous Colleague. He was frequent in duties of Humiliation, and Thankſgiving. Sometimes five or ſix hours in Prayer, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119081:10"/>
opening of the Word, ſo undefatigable in the Lords work, ſo willing to ſpend and to be ſpent. He anſwered many Letters that were ſent far and near, wherein were handled many difficult caſes of Conſcience, and many doubts cleered to great ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>He was a man exceedingly loved and admired of the beſt, and reverenced of the worſt of his hearers. He was in great favour with Doctor <hi>Williams,</hi> the then Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> who much eſteemed him for his learning, and (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to report) when he was Lord keeper of the great Seal, went to King <hi>James,</hi> and ſpeaking of Mr <hi>Cottons</hi> great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and worth, the King was willing notwithſtanding his non-conformity, to give way that he ſhould have his liberty without interruption in his Miniſtry, which was the more notable conſidering how that Kings ſpirit was carried out againſt ſuch men. Alſo, the Earl of <hi>Dorceſter</hi> being at <hi>Old-Boſton,</hi> and hearing Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> preaching concerning (if me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory fail not) Civil-Government, He was ſo affected with the Wiſdom of his words and Spirit, that he did ever after highly account of him, and put himſelf forth what he could in the time of Mr <hi>Cottons</hi> troubles to deliver him out of them, that his <hi>Boſton</hi> might enjoy him as formerly; but he found ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places too ſtrongly oppoſite to his Deſires.</p>
            <p>About this time he married his ſecond Wife, Mris <hi>Sarah Story,</hi> then a Widow. He was bleſſed above many in his marriages, both his Wives being pious Matrons, grave, ſober, faithful, like <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche,</hi> Fellow-Laborers with him in the Goſpel; by the firſt he had no Children; the laſt God made a Fruitful Vine unto him. His Firſt-born ſhe brought forth far off upon the Sea: He that left <hi>Europe</hi> childleſs, arived a joyfull Father in <hi>America;</hi> God who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to be with his ſervants when they paſſe through the Waters, having cauſed him to embrace a Son by the way; In memorial whereof he called his name <hi>Seaborn,</hi> to keep alive (ſaid he) in mee, and to teach him if he live, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Sea-mercies, from the hand of a gracious God. He is yet living, and now entred into the Work of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119081:10"/>
the Miniſtry. A Son of many prayers, and of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
            <p>The time being now come wherein God purpoſed to uperadd unto what had formerly been, a practical and more notable Teſtimony againſt the intermixing of humane inventions with Inſtitutions Divine, and to the Goſpel Church-worſhip, and Politie in their purity, he in his All-wiſe providence tranſplants many of his Faithfull ſervants into this vaſt Wilderneſs as a place in reſpect of it's remoteneſs ſo much the fitter for the fuller inquiry after, and free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all his holy ordinances, and together therewith for the holding forth a pregnant demonſtration of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of Civil-Government with a Congregational-way God giveth <hi>Moſes</hi> the pattern of the Tabernacle in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſeeth the formes of the Houſe in exile. <hi>John</hi> receiveth his Revelation in <hi>Patmos.

His fliglit was not like that of <hi>Pliny's</hi> Mice, that forſake a houſe foreſeeing the ruine of it; or of Mercenaries, who flie from duty in time of danger: but Providence Divine ſhutting up the door of ſervice in <hi>England,</hi> and on the other hand opening it in <hi>New-England,</hi> he was guided both by the word and eye of the Lord. And as <hi>David</hi> yielded upon the perſwaſion of his men to abſent himſelf from danger, ſo he ſuffered himſelf to be perſwaded by his friends to withdraw from the luſt of his Perſecutors, for the preſervation of ſo precious a light in Iſrael; after the example of <hi>Jacob, Moſes,</hi> the Prophets which <hi>Obadiah</hi> hid in the caves, <hi>Polycarp, Athanaſius,</hi> yea and Chriſt himſelf; <hi>When they perſecute you in one City, flie unto another.

            <p>Thus this Infant and ſmall Commonwealth being now capacitated both in reſpect of Civil and Church-eſtate, to walk with God according to the preſcript of his Word; it was the good hand of the Lord unto his ſervants who had afflicted their ſouls to ſeek of him a right way for themſelves, their little ones, and their ſubſtance, to ſend unto them (amongſt many others) this man of underſtanding, that might be unto them as eyes in this wilderneſs. His manner of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119081:12"/>
entrance unto them was with much bleſſing. For at his firſt coming, he found them not without ſome troubles about ſetling the matters of the Church and Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> (being requeſted) preaching before the General Court out of <hi>Haggai 2. 4. Yet now be ſtrong O Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel, ſaith the Lord, be ſtrong O Joſhua ſon of Joſedek the High-Prieſt, and be ſtrong all ye people of the land, ſaith the Lord, and work; for I am with you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> As <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> ſometimes by his Oration healed that <note place="margin">Liv. hiſtor. lib 2. cap. 32.</note> then-threatning breach between the Fathers and the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo through the Lords working mightily by this Sermon, all obſtructions were preſently removed, and the ſpirits of all ſorts, as <hi>one man,</hi> were excited unanimouſly and vigorouſly in the work of the Lord from that day.</p>
            <p>In order whereunto the Court conſidering, That that people of God, all the members of which Republick were Church-members, were to be governed conformably to the Law of God, deſired Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> to draw an Abſtract of the Judicial Laws delivered from God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo far forth as they were of moral <hi>(ie</hi> of perpetual and univerſal) equity. Which he did, adviſing them to perſiſt in their purpoſe of eſtabliſhing a <hi>Theocraty (i. e.</hi> Gods Government) over Gods people. It was an uſual thing henceforth for the Magiſtrate to conſult with the Miniſters in hard caſes, eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Lord: yet ſo, as notwithſtanding occaſional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, religious care was had of avoiding confuſion of Counſels: <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> rejoiced, and kiſſed one another in the mount of God. After which time, how uſeful he was to <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>N.

In the courſe of his Miniſtery in <hi>New-Boſton,</hi> by way of Expoſition, he went through the Old-Teſtament unto <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. the whole New-Teſtament once through, and the ſecond time unto the middle of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Upon Lords days and Lecture-days, he preached through the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles, Haggai, Zechary, Ezra,</hi> the <hi>Revelation, Eccleſiaſtes, Canticles,</hi> the Second and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119081:12"/>
Third Epiſtles of <hi>John,</hi> the Epiſtle of <hi>Titus,</hi> both the Epiſtles of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> with other Scriptures: The preſence of the Lord being mighty with him, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his labours to the Converſion of many ſouls, and the Edification of thouſands.

            <p>His youth was unſtained, whence he was ſo much the more <note place="margin">His unſtained youth.</note> capable of being an excellent Inſtrument in the Church in his after-age. Many do that evil whilſt they are young, which makes them unable (at leaſt comparatively) to do ſo much good when they are old.

The gratefulneſe of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent liquor unto the ſtomach, depends in part upon the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the veſſel. We may be good men, if we have a good Conſcience; but we are not like to do much good, if we have not a good Name. Our Religion, our Report, and our Eye muſt not be plaid withal. It is a ſmart admonition mentioned by <hi>Sturmius</hi> in his Claſſical Epiſtles, when upon ſuch an one reading out of <hi>Tully's Offices,</hi> who himſelf was not of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed life, his hearer objects, <hi>Docet officinm, non facit</hi>

more learned. One man is not born to all things. No calling (beſides Divine requiſites) calleth for more Abilities, or a larger meaſure of humane knowledge then the Miniſtery; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly therefore is his praiſe great in all the Churches, that he not only gave himſelf thereunto, but exceeded many that had done virtuouſly therein. The greater part of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuclopaideia</hi> he excelled in. Thoſe Arts which the Univerſity requireth ſuch a proficiency from her graduates in, he both digeſted and refined by his more accurate knowledge of them. He was a good <hi>Hebrician,</hi> in Greek a Critick, and could with great facility both ſpeak and write Latine in a pure and elegant Ciceronian Stile, a good Hiſtorian, no ſtranger to the Fathers, Councils, or School-men: Abundantly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Commentators of all ſorts. His Library was great, his reading and learning anſwerable, himſelf a living and better Library. Though he was a conſtant Student, yet he had all his Learning out of his Books. He was a man of much Communion with God, and acquaintance with his own heart, obſerving the daily paſſages of his life. He had a deep ſight into the Myſtery of Gods grace, and mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and large apprehenſions of theſe things. It was wont to be ſaid, <hi>Bonus textuarius eſt bonus Theologus:</hi> A good Text man is a good Divine; If you look upon him in that notion, he was an Expoſitor (without offence be it ſpoken) not inferior to any of this more ſublimated age; That great Motto ſo much wondred at, <hi>Labore &amp; Conſtantiâ,</hi>

A Candle may ſpend too faſt: And the improvement of the light whilſt it is yet burning admits of degrees; beſides his preaching in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, he was daily preſſed, if not oppreſſed, with the care and ſervice of the Churches; Attendance to perſonal caſes, and manifold other Imployments inevitably put upon him, both from abroad and at home, whence the time remaining (which is not a little to be lamented) was inſufficient to attend doctrinal, and eſpecial Polemical ſcripts, ſuch as the cauſe of the truth, occurents of Providence, and his peculiar engagements called for. He was free to give his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when deſired, but declined arbitration and umpirage in civil differences between man and man, as <hi>Heterogeneus</hi> both to his office and ſpirit. His courſe like that of Celeſtical

In conſcience whereof, he himſelf riſing betimes in the morning, as ſoon as he was ready, called his family together (which was alſo his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the evening) to the ſolemn worſhip of God; reading, and expounding, and occaſionally applying the Scripture unto them, always beginning and ending with prayer. In caſe of ſin committed by child or ſervant, he would call them aſide privately (the matter ſo requiring)

            <p>He began the Sabbath at evening; therefore then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Family-duty after ſupper, being larger then ordinary in Expoſition, after which he Catechiſed his children and ſervants, and then returned into his Study. The morning following, Family-worſhip being ended, he retired into his Study, until the Bell called him away. Upon his return from Meeting, he returned again into his Study (the place of his labour and prayer) unto his private devotion: where (having a ſmall repaſt carried him up for his dinner) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the tolling of the bell. The publick ſervice being over, he withdrew for a ſpace to his prementioned Oratory for his ſacred addreſſes unto God, as in the forenoon; then came down, repeated the Sermon in the family, prayed, after ſupper ſung a Pſalm, and towards bed-time betaking himſelf again to his Study, he cloſed the day with prayer. Thus he ſpent the Sabbath continually.</p>
            <p>In his Study, he neither ſate down unto, nor aroſe from his meditations without prayer: whilſt his eyes were upon his book, his expectation was from God. He had learned to ſtudy, becauſe he had learned to pray: An able Student, a Goſpel-Student, becauſe unable to ſtudy without Jeſus Chriſt. The barrenneſs of his meditation at ſome times, yea though his endeavour were moſt intenſe upon a good matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him whence it was, that his heart muſing upon the ſame ſubject at another time, his tongue became as the pen of a ready writer. As he was not (comparatively) wanting in Parts, Learning, or Induſtry; ſo was he more careful not to truſt in them, but to fix his dependence totally upon God.

of Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his Examination of Mr. <hi>Cotton's</hi> Treatiſe of Predeſtination; from whom he acknowledged that he received light thereby, and was ready to atteſt the great abilities of the Doctor, that Star (if any of this Age) of the firſt magnitude. 'Tis true, Mr. <hi>Cotton's</hi> mind was then exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed concerning the point of Reprobation: Touching the point of Election, 'tis ſufficiently known he was not only Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, but alſo clear. As there were of old that pretended the Predeſtinarian hereſie to have had its riſe from <hi>Auſtin;</hi> and <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> of late bluſhed not to ſay of the famous Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> that <hi>Arminianorum malleus, Ameſius Pelagianizat, Ames</hi> Pelagianizeth. So, the wonder is leſs, if this ſound and judicious Divine hath not eſcaped the imputation of Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm from ſome, notwithſtanding the redundant teſtimony of his Doctrine, and generally of all that knew him, to the contrary; yea, that occaſionally he hath been heard to ſay by Teſtimony yet alive, and above exception, That he looked at Arminianiſm as another Goſpel, and directly contrary to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace. What <hi>Melancthon</hi> (our <note place="margin">Mi Doctor, non quaero meam gloriam in hoc negotio, ſed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem.</note> ordinary Parallel) ſometimes ſaid of himſelf to <hi>Eccius,</hi> may here be truly applied to him: Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his Diſputations ſought not his glory, but Gods truth. So able an Opponent was rare; ſo candid an Opponent more rare. He that fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, was likely to fall ſoft enough ordinarily (except through his own default) not likely to loſe any thing beſides his Error.</p>
            <p>A mans wiſdom maketh his face to ſhine. He had a happy, <note place="margin">His Wiſdom.</note> a quick, comprehenſive, and benign Underſtanding, as having received the manifeſtation of the Spirit, for the ſervice and profit of others. To diſcover the mind of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſentence of Judgment, in matters too hard for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Judges, was no ſmall part both of the worth and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of him that was to miniſter before the Lord. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> proved <hi>Solomon</hi> with hard queſtions. There is ſcarce any gift that more approximates the Receiver unto that which the learned call a Divine, then an ability in ſome meaſure to ſend away religious Caſuiſts, as the Wiſe-man did that renowned Queſtioniſt, which communed with him of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119081:17"/>
all that was in her heart; And <hi>Solomon</hi> told her all her queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; there was not any thing hid from the king that he told her not. It ſeemed good unto the Father of lights to make this happy inſtrument, not only to excell his Brethren, but in many reſpects, upon this Account to excell himſelf: A grace ſo far acknowledged in him, as that all ſorts, both the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and private perſons, learned and unlearned, exerciſed with their reſpective caſes of Conſcience, waited under God in ſpecial manner upon his lips for knowledge, and ſought the Law at his mouth. Hear to this purpoſe the Teſtimony of Mr <hi>Davenport</hi> that Eminent and Reverend man of God, the faithful Paſtor of the Church at <hi>New-Haven</hi> (a Witneſs above many) in his own words, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;</p>

               <p>His forced flight from <hi>Boſton</hi> to <hi>London</hi> for his ſafety, from perſuit of the purſevants ſent to apprehend him, I well remember: and admire the ſpecial providence of God towards my ſelf and ſome others in it, amongſt whom ſafe retirement and hiding places were, provided for him, in and about London. For ſome of us agreed together to improve that opportunity for a conference with him, about the grounds of his judgment and practice, whereby the Church was in danger to be deprived of him, and of the benefit of his precious gifts, hoping that God might bleſſe the ſame, for the communicating of further light, either to him or to us. Two points were the principal ſubject of our diſcourſe.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Touching the office of Biſhops, whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Biſhops be appointed to rule a dioceſſe, or a particular Congregation.

as were either produced, or invented, and urged by any of our ſelves: Unto all which he anſwered with great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture light, compoſedneſs of mind, mildneſs of Spirit, conſtant adhering to his principles, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them unſhaken, and himſelf from varying from them by any thing ſpoken <hi>ad oppoſitum.</hi> When I obſerved, that all this he did not in ſpeech only, but alſo in ſundry wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (the Copies whereof I have) without the help of any book but the Scriptures, wherein he was mighty; and yet matters that required variety of reading, whether for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the truth, or confutation of the contrary, fell frequently into diſcourſe <hi>inter partes;</hi> I admired Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with him, and aſſiſtance of him, quickening his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and invention, ſtrengthening his memory, compoſing his mind, and governing his Spirit far beyond what I had taken notice of any man before him. The reaſon of our deſire to confer with him rather then any other touching theſe weighty points, was our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer knowledge of his approved Godlineſs, excellent learning, ſound judgment, eminent gravity, candor, and ſweet temper of Spirit, whereby he could placidly bear thoſe that differed from him in their apprehenſions. All which and much more we found, and glorified God, in him, and for him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>So equal a contention between Learning and Meekneſs is ſeldom viſible in any one perſon. Of <hi>Moſes</hi> we thus read, Now the man <hi>Moſes</hi> was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the Earth. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of thoſe that knew him appealed to, he will be acknowledged amongſt the meekeſt of the Earth in his days.</p>
            <p>I am forced here to make a pauſe: So conſpicuous was this grace in him, that multitudes beheld it, not without making extraordinary mention therof. 'Tis true, he had an advantage above many in his natural conſtitution; and its influence from his education, heightned intellectuals, and moralities, was not inconſiderable; but that which gave the being of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſanctified &amp; perfected all, was the grace of Chriſt.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119081:18"/>
He was of an acute apprehenſion, therefore eaſily ſenſible of; but ſo little in his own ſpirit, that he was not eaſily provoked by an injury. Senſibleneſs of diſhonor done to God by ſin, or of what the offender had done unto himſelf by ſinning, left ſuch impreſſions upon him, as that his taking notice of any injury done unto himſelf, was not uſually taken notice of. He had well learned that leſſon of <hi>Gregory;</hi> It is better often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to flie from an injury by ſilence, then to overcome it by replying. It was <hi>Grynaeus</hi> manner, to revenge wrongs <note place="margin">Glorioſius est injuriam ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo fugere, quàm reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo ſuperare.</note> with Chriſtian taciturnity. <hi>Melancthon</hi> overcomes <hi>Luther's</hi> anger, and his own grief, with mildneſs, patience, and prayer. The non-reſiſtance and ſoftneſs of the Wooll breaks the force of the Cannon, and ſo ſaveth both the bullet and it ſelf. If Inferiors expoſtulated unneceſſarily with him, he would pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently hear them, and give them a brotherly account, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their minds with a gentle, grave, and reſpective anſwer. Take one inſtance of that kind in ſtead of many, unto one of his Hearers then ſick of ſingularities, and leſs able to bear ſound doctrine; following him home after his publick labors in the Aſſembly, and in ſtead of better encouragement telling him that his Miniſtry was become either dark, or flat: He gently anſwered, <hi>Both, Brother!</hi> without further opening his mouth in his defence; chooſing rather to own the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then to expoſtulate with the Imputer.</p>
            <p>Diſputations are great trials of the ſpirits of intelligent men. <hi>Hooper</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> were patient Martyrs, yet ſomewhat impatient Diſputers. The Synod held at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were then circumſtanced, was unto this good man an hour of temptation, above what ordinarily had befallen him in his pilgrimage; yet ſuch was his eminent behaviour throughout, as argued in the conſcience of the ſpectators ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular patience, and left him a Mirror for the temperament, mildneſs, and government of his ſpirit. Pious meekneſs fits for Church-ſociety. It was he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than whom was not a meeker man upon earth, who continued Iſrael in Church-communion, and continued in communion with Iſrael, notwithſtanding their manners in the wilderneſs. To inſtitute, and preſerve inſtrumentally Church-communion, Goſpel-fellowſhip, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,

and purity, in the exerciſes that accompany the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of (as it were) a Nation out of a Nation, Change of Eccleſiaſtical government, with the many temptations of this Deſart, called for another <hi>Moſes:</hi> Neither the ſpirit of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration nor pollution can attain it. To hold communion with men that are ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without having communion with their ſin, is the only ſociable ſpirit. To extend communion where the rule commands, and to deny communion where the rule forbids, qualifieth us to live with God and man. They that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak. Pillars muſt be bearers, elſe the building falls. The infirmities of the weak brethren, are the trials and burdens of thoſe whieh are ſtrong. It fareth ill with the little one, when the frowardneſs of the Child exceeds the patience of the Nurſe. Thoſe things in nature which cannot ſuffer, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mixe. Timber that will not endure cutting, is unfit for jointing. The ſword that is good metal will bow to the hilts, and yet come ſtrait again. No metal more ſolid then gold, no metal more yielding under the hammer. The ſame Heaven hath the name of Firmament for its ſtability, and of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe for its being ſtretch'd out like a curtain, and compaſſing about the reſidue of the Creation. The ſinews which are the members of moſt ſtrength, are alſo members flexible every way, for the better motion of the whole body. Denial of regular communion, is injurious to the body. Rigor is ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, Indulgence is defiling, both are ſcandalous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive. Piety and meekneſs preſerve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. <hi>Eccius</hi> ſometimes acknowledged unto <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that his mildneſs, and <hi>Pontanus</hi> his good lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, had been very beneficial to the Proteſtant cauſe. Yet though he was ſo gentle, meek, and flexible, that men might perſwade him above what could be uſually expected from men of his worth; in the things of God he was ſtedfaſt and unmoveable. <hi>Moſes</hi> the meekeſt of men, in the cauſe of God would not yield in the leaſt: <hi>Our cattel alſo ſhall go with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there ſhall not an hoof be left behind.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119081:19"/>
the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is commended becauſe ſhe cannot ſuffer thoſe that do evil. <hi>Melancthon's</hi> milde nature, when ſpiritualized and quickned by grace, drew forth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of an Enemy; but being left unto it ſelf, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to his friend to complain: And here, ſaith Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quinetiam tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am fidem &amp; diligentiam, ſancte Philippe, deſidero.</hi> Brightman in Apoc. cap. 3.</note> (relating to the ſpringing and ſpreading gangrene of Conſubſtantiation) I find thee wanting, O holy <hi>Philip! Luther</hi> at times is too angry; <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſometimes is too remiſs. The anger of the Old-man is a ſin; the anger of the New-man is a duty. <hi>Jacob</hi> curſeth the anger of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs; God bleſſeth the zeal of <hi>Phineas.</hi> The Sanctuary cannot want the fire which is from heaven, neither may it be touched with the fire which is from hell. Gentleneſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, when actuated by Chriſt, makes us ſo much the more acceptable and profitable unto man: But if the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his aſſiſtance, we fall ſhort of reaching Gods ends, and the ſeaſonable ſuppreſſion of exorbitancie. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, if this good man had always had that voice ſounding in his heart, which one wiſhed that mild Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſen</hi> might have heard from the Smiths forge, <hi>[Dureſce, dureſce, utinam &amp; Lantgravius dureſcat!]</hi> haply there are that think ſome diſorders, diſturbances, and irregularities might have been prevented by Gods bleſſing.</p>
            <p>But ordinarily, and in matters of greateſt weight the Lord was with him. Though his forbearance was both obſervable and very imitable in the things that concerned himſelf, yet he could not forbear them whom he knew to be evil. An experience whereof we ſaw concerning ſome Heterodox ſpirits, who by their ſpecious diſcourſes of Free-grace, and ſubdolous concealings of their principles, ſo far deceived him into a better opinion of them then there was cauſe, as that notwithſtanding they fathered their Errors upon him in general, and abuſed his Doctrine to the countenancing of their denial of Inherent grace in particular; yet he was ſlow to believe theſe things of them, and ſlower to bear witneſs againſt them. But ſo ſoon as the truth herein appeared to him, hear his own words taken out of his Letter written to Mr. <hi>Davenport.</hi> 
               <q>The truth is (ſaith he) the body of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119081:19"/>
Iſland is bent to backſliding into error and deluſions: The Lord pity and pardon them, and me alſo, who have been ſo ſlow to ſee their windings, and ſubtile contrivances, and inſinuations in all their tranſactions, whilſt they propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated their Opinions under my Expreſſions, diverted to their conſtructions. Yea, ſuch was his ingenuity and piety,</q> as that his ſoul was not ſatisfied without often breaking forth into affectionate bewailing of his infirmity herein, in the publick Aſſembly, ſometimes in his Prayer, ſometimes in his Sermon, and that with tears.</p>
            <p>He was a man of an ingenuous and pious candor, rejoicing <note place="margin">His Candor.</note> (as opportunity ſerved) to take notice of, and teſtifie unto the gifts of God in his brethen; thereby drawing the hearts of them to him, and of others to them; both to their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and the edification of many. He did not think himſelf a loſer by putting honor upon his Fellow-Elders, but was willing they ſhould communicate with him in the eſteem and love of the people. He was not only a ſon of peace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the continual feaſt of a good conſcience with ſerenity and tranquillity of affections at home; but alſo a Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, qualified by the graces forementioned to be a choice Inſtrument in the hand of the Prince of Peace, amongſt the Churches. Where, if any differences aroſe, he was ready (being called thereunto) to afford his help for the compoſing of them; and had a ſingular faculty and ability therein, by that excellent wiſdom, and moderation of ſpirit, which God in Chriſt had given him, whoſe bleſſing alſo did ordinarily crown his endeavours with good ſucceſs.</p>

The Goſpel opened his heart, his lips, and the doors of his Houſe. A Biſhop then muſt be given to Hoſpitality; apt to teach; as we have ſeen him Didactical, ſo you ſhall find him Hoſpital.

               <hi>Semper aliquis in Cydonis dome.</hi> Some years ſince there was brought unto <hi>Boſton</hi> a report of the Neceſſity of the poor Saints at <hi>Sigataea,</hi> a little Church, (whereof the Reverend Mr. <hi>White</hi> then was, and yet is their faithful Paſtor) which ſuffered much extremity by reaſon of the perſecution of their then-prevailing adverſaries, forcing them from <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas</hi> into the Deſart-continent. The ſound of whoſe diſtreſs was no ſooner heard of, but you might have heard the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his bowels, with many others, applying themſelves unto a ſpeedy Collection, and tranſporting it to them on purpoſe, for their ſeaſonable relief: when after the example of the Churches in <hi>Galatia, Macedonia, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> ſending their liberalities unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the days of the famine foretold by <hi>Agabus,</hi> the ſame grace abounding in the Churches of theſe parts, they ſupplied them to the value of about Seven hundred pounds; Two hundred pounds whereof were gathered in the Church of <hi>Boſton,</hi> no man in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119081:20"/>
the Contribution exceeding, and but one equalling the bounty of their then-Teacher. It is here remarkable, that this Collection arrived there the very day (or thereabouts) after thoſe poor people were brought to a perſonal diviſion of that little meal then remaining in the barrel, and not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to man, but that after the eating thereof they muſt die a lingring death for want of food; And the ſame day that their Paſtor preached to them (it being the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) out of <hi>Pſal. 23. 1. The Lord is my Shepherd, I ſhall not want:</hi> At ſuch a time the good hand of the Lord brought this ſuccor to them from afar.

            <p>Yet the meaſure of the afflictions of Chriſt in this kind, appointed to be ſuffered by him in the fleſh, was not fulfilled: But lo, in the time of his Exile, ſome Brethren (we do not ſay they were not of us, being willing to hope better things) provoked by the Cenſure of Authority, though juſtly, and not without tears inflicted upon them, ſingle out him as a chief object of their diſpleaſure; who though above other men declining irregular and unneceſſary intereſting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the actions of the Magiſtrate, and (while opportunity laſted) endeavouring their healing, yet muſt now be requited evil for good; and that by ſome of them, who were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly companions with him in the tribulations of this <hi>Patmos,</hi> Reſpecters of him, had taken ſweet counſel together, and walked in the houſe of God as friends. Hence is he with pen and tongue blaſphemed by them, for whom he formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119081:21"/>
and for whom he both then and afterwards wept and put on ſackcloth. Such buffetings of Satan, though ſharp, are medicinal at times to the excellent upon earth, who by reaſon of the body of death indwelling, muſt be kept weak, that they may be made ſtrong.</p>
            <p>Since this time alſo ſome reverend, learned, and godly men (haply in zeal againſt the Congregational-way) ſharpened their ſtyle againſt him. Which if it be the truth, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is, their ſpeaking ſo much <hi>ad hominem,</hi> eſpecially to ſuch a man, whoſe love to any good man much exceeded their diſpleaſure to him, argueth too much of man. Howſoever he was then a ſufferer for the Truth: In which reſpect the pious and ingenuous ſpirit of learned Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> though in purſuance of the Truth he diſputes <hi>ad idem,</hi> and with ſtrength, which is his praiſe and acceptable, yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly carrieth it as to a Brother, not to an Adverſary. There is an exceſs in too much ſalt, and not a little to be complained of in perſonal and cauſeleſs aſperſions from good men: That ſmarts, theſe defile; That makes leſs comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, theſe tend us to make us unprofitable. Roſes are not without their pricks. The Archers have ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, and were diſpleaſed with him; but his Bowe abode in ſtrength, &amp; the arms of his hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob:</hi> From thence is the Shepherd and the Stone of Iſrael. An honeſt-minded man <note place="margin">Plutarch. de capienda ex hoſtibus utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate libellus.</note> (ſaith <hi>Xenophon)</hi> gets by enmity: And <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes a Treatiſe concerning benefiting by our Enemies, adorning his diſcourſe with that of <hi>Jaſon</hi> of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> whoſe Enemy ſtabbing him, and intending his death, only opened an ulcer otherwiſe incurable, and ſo ſaved his life. If men without God in the world having only ſtar-light, and ſcarce ſo much as ſeeing men walk like trees, only feeling after the Lord, have thus ſpoken; we ſee the greater encouragement why Chriſtians, who are made light by the Father of Light, and know Him that is Love, may (through grace) not only ſpeak better, but alſo practiſe accordingly. <hi>Job</hi> can turn the book written againſt him by his adverſaries, into a crown. <hi>Joſeph</hi> feeling the benefit of the Patriarchs unkindneſs, is the more

            <p>Many inſtances we have in Hiſtory of Diſſention in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Hereſies following upon theſe Meteors: A Comet preceded the Furies of the Enthuſiaſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> 1533. the genuine offſpring of whom is that generation commonly known by the name of <hi>Quakers.</hi> Comets are ſignal, though not cauſal: They are ſignal as to changes of Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which befall men, though they have no cauſal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the minds of men. And be it ſo, that in themſelves ſimply conſidered, future Events, whether good or evil, are illegible; yet when they are placed in Conjunction with Scripture-predictions concerning the iniquities of men, ripening for the execution of Divine vengeance, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119081:25"/>
according to the word of their Creator, they are not without inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> (upon his enquiry after the motion of this Comet) being asked what he himſelf conceived of it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That he thought it portended great Changes in the Churches. But that which further calleth upon us not to be unmindful of ſadder Viciſſitudes probably impending, is the formidable Apoſtacie both from the Order and Faith of the Goſpel, appearing and threatening us in this Age. Chriſt mentions prodigious Tenets of falſe Prophets, and falſe <note place="margin">Marth. 24.</note> Chriſts ariſing, as (ſometimes at the leaſt) ſignal of Publick calamities. As the concurrence of multitude of Hereſies and mutability in Religion, which gave occaſion to that oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious <note place="margin">Fides menſtrua</note> and horrid Proverb, <hi>The Chriſtians Faith is menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> was a means to bring in Antichriſt: ſo the preſent ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation of Conſciences, and of the Civil Eſtates with uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and manifold Hereſie in matter of Faith, hath no ſmall tendencie to bring back the Infallible Chair. People will accept of a quiet Harbor, though upon hard conditions, rather then be afflicted with continual toſſings in ſtormy Seas. 'Tis natural to man to covet any quiet Land, rather then to dwell with the terror of a continual Earthquake.

            <p>It was no deſpicable ſtratagem of the old Serpent, knowing the time of the paſſion of Chriſt, and of the baptiſm of the Apoſtles, with the baptiſm wherewith he was to be baptized then approaching; to indiſpoſe the minds of the Diſciples thereunto, by poſſeſſing them with a pleaſing, but falſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a glorious and temporal Kingdom of Chriſt in this world to be at hand. Perſecution doubtleſs had been a more ſuitable meditation for <hi>Iames</hi> then to ſeek great things for himſelf; who notwithſtanding his dream of a Kingdom, was not long after killed by the ſword of <hi>Herod.</hi> Time will ſhew, whether we have more cauſe to fear the death of the Witneſſes yet to come, or to conclude the time of their ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth to be over. His advertiſement ſeemeth weighty that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119081:25"/>
telleth us, <hi>A credulous ſecurity of their death as paſt, if yet</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plus ſiquident ad pietatem valet calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis futurae expectatio, quàm credula nimis de ea quaſi jam tranſacta ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitas.</hi> Mead Com. Apoc. cap. 11.</note> 
               <hi>to come, is a more perillous error, then the expectation of it as to come, though already paſt.</hi> An awful waiting for a calamity conduceth more to piety, then a ſecure putting from us the thoughts of the evil day. The Diſciples not minding the prediction of Chriſts ſufferings, but over-minding an external ſtate of glory, meeting with the Croſs, were ſo offended, as that they were not free from ſad miſgivings of heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Saviour: <hi>But we trusted that it had been be that ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi> Whereas on the other hand the poor <hi>Albigenſes</hi> fighting the battels of Chriſt Jeſus in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Goſpel againſt <hi>Simon Montfort,</hi> though over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by him with a great ſlaughter, and upon that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of providence taken, ſollicited by the Biſhop of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> (then interceding for them) that now God having by the event of war determined for the Romaniſts againſt them, they would return from their Hereſie unto the Catholick faith: They (at ſuch a time) having ſeaſonably in their hearts that Prophecie, <hi>And it was given unto them to make</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Revel. 13. 7.</note> 
               <hi>war with the Saints, and to overcome them;</hi> anſwered, That they were the people of God appointed to be overcome. Thus they ſtrengthened their faith, by being overthrown; they overcame the temptation, by being overcome; and ſo not accepting of deliverance, were all ſlain to a man. Poor <hi>Albigenſes</hi> looking ſeaſonably at calamities to come, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; the Diſciples looking unſeaſonably at a Kingdom to come, are overcome.</p>
            <p>Times are in the hands of God, and to diſcern the times is the gift of God. Being deſigned to ſuffer is not ſo great an evil, as grace to ſuffer for the Deſigners ſake, is good: The condition of the Witneſſes is higher in the Promiſes of the great God, then it is low in the Street of the great City. Their Aſcenſion into Heaven after three days and a half, is legible long before their death. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi>

That Motto ſomewhat <note place="margin">Post tenebras lux.</note> altered by them of <hi>Geneva,</hi> is in this ſenſe as true, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119081:26"/>

                  <hi>Stupor ne ſit an Spiritus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derit chriſtus non valdè tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batus ſum. &amp;c.</hi> Mel. Adam. in vita Lutheri.</note> yea, I hope as concerning the Event, above what I hoped. God is able to raiſe up the dead: God is able to preſerve his cauſe, though falling; to raiſe it up again though falne; to promote when ſtanding; if we be not worthy, let it be done by others. <hi>Jacob</hi> foretelling the predetermined and afflicting viciſſitudes concerning the tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himfelf in a ſafe iſſue of all, as to Religion, and the ſincere profeſſors thereof, thus: <hi>I have waited for thy ſalvation, O God!</hi> Salvation is a full remedy: And then is opportunity for the ſalvation of God, when the Churches tribulation is ſuch, as, that out of it, none but God can ſave.</p>
            <p>The fixing of a Beleevers eye aright, hath a vivifical and marvellous influence upon his heart. Chriſt beholding the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame. A Chriſtian runneth cheerfully and undefiledly, over the fouleſt part of the race ſet before him, looking unto <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The Council looking on <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw his face as it had been the face of an Angel: The reaſon is, <hi>Stephen</hi> looked ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, and ſeeth the Son of man ſtanding at the right hand of God. The beſt of the ſervants of God have lived in the worſt times. <hi>Noah</hi> was not ſo unhappy that he lived in an unrighteous Generation, as he was happy in being righteous in that generation Though the captivity took up ſo much of <hi>Daniels</hi> life, yet when he ſhall ſtand in his lot, at the end of days, it ſhall be no griefe of heart unto him, that he was both to ſpend and end his days in <hi>Babylon.</hi> It will be as well with thoſe at that day who fulfilled their courſe upon earth, propheſying in ſackcloth, as with thoſe who are reſerved to live in the glorious times of the Goſpel. It is not material in what Age we live; but that we live as we ought, in that Age wherein we live.</p>
